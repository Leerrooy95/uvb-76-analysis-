UVB-76 signal correlation analysis + open research method
# UVB-76 Signal Correlation Analysis  
*By [Leerrooy95] | November 2025*

> **TL;DR** – 7 voice messages on 4625 kHz aligned within 6 hours of major Russian military/diplomatic events (2010–2025).  
> **p < 0.01 vs random.** Not conclusive — just suggestive.  
> **Everything below is public, timestamped, and reproducible.**

### Files in this repo
| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `uvb_logs.csv` | Raw transmission timestamps (Priyom.org archive) |
| `event_timeline.csv` | Geopolitical anchors (state media, MOD releases) |
| `correlation.ipynb` | Python alignment + stats |
| `timeline.png` | Visual map |
| `RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.pdf` | **How anyone can do this — on any topic** |
| `sources/` | PDFs, screenshots, fetch dates |

### Want to verify or challenge?
1. Clone → `git clone https://github.com/yourname/uvb-76-analysis`
2. Open `correlation.ipynb` → run all cells
3. Open an **Issue** if something breaks

### Not into signals?  
The same 5 steps in `RESEARCH_METHODOLOGY.pdf` work for:
- VA wait times
- Local policy changes
- Social-media comment storms
- Anything with dates and observations

*No expertise required. Just curiosity and a timeline.*
